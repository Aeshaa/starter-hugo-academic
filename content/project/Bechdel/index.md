### Introduction
<!-- Before we begin, have you heard of the Bechdel Test? 

If not, allow me to share an anecdote - -->

What is the Bechdel Test?

It is a 3-question litmus test to gauge gender bias in movies. These are fairly basic questions -

1. The movie must feature at least two women in it.  
2. The women must talk to each other.  
3. Their discussion must be about something other than a man.  

Simple, right?

Well, a surprising number of movies do not pass this simple test.
