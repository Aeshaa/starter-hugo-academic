### Introduction
<!-- Before we begin, have you heard of the Bechdel Test? 

If not, allow me to share an anecdote - -->

What is the Bechdel Test?

There are 3 simple rules that the movie must follow to pass this -
1. The movie must feature at least two women in it.  
2. The women must talk to each other.  
3. Their discussion must be about something other than a man.
