If, like me, you're a Sherlock Holmes geek, you'll likely find this project as fascinating as I did. And even if you're not a fan, let's admit it – it's difficult not to be impressed by the power of deduction. Bear with me, and picture this: a crime scene as a cryptic novel, waiting to be deciphered. Now, add Augmented Reality to the narrative — a digital detective donning smart lenses, leading us on a virtual exploration, or perhaps crafting a 3D reconstruction of the mystery at hand. This isn't your typical detective story; this is a technological non-fiction where reality and augmentation tango, promising a new era in forensic investigation.

With the goal of enhancing early investigation methods, this paper explores the Augmented Reality (AR) technologies that can be integrated, potentially transforming Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) approaches.
