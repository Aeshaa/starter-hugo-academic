If you're a Sherlock Holmes geek like me, you'll likely find this project as fascinating as I did. And even if you're not a fan, let's admit it – it's difficult not to be impressed by the power of deduction. 

Bear with me, and picture this: a crime scene as a cryptic novel, waiting to be deciphered. Now, add Augmented Reality to the narrative — a digital detective donning smart lenses, leading us on a virtual exploration, or perhaps crafting a 3D reconstruction of the mystery at hand. This isn't your typical detective story; this is a technological non-fiction where reality and augmentation tango, promising a new era in forensic investigation.

### Introduction
With the goal of enhancing early investigation methods, this paper explored the Augmented Reality (AR) technologies that could be integrated, potentially transforming Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) approaches.


### AR Technologies studied:
#### 1. HoloLens
